### Introduction
The stock market is inherently chaotic and unpredictable, but we can use the tendency of chaotic variables to revert to their historical means to create generate predictions about the behavior of such variables.
The more extreme a variable's deviation from the norm, the more likely it is to return to a typical state, and the project uses this idea to identify securities with the greatest deviation and are therefore most likely to revert.
If you'd like to know more about the motivation behind this project and Mean Reversion generally, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMhVuZa6VtY) great video from Fractal Manhattan.
